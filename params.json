{"name":"Paip-python","tagline":"Peter Norvig's Paradigms of AI Programming implemented in Python","body":"paip-python\r\n===========\r\n\r\nPython implementations of some of the classic AI programs from Peter Norvig's\r\nfantastic textbook \"Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming.\"\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is meant to be a learning resource for beginning AI programmers.  Although\r\nPAIP is a fantastic book, it is no longer common for students to have a\r\nbackground in Lisp programming, as many universities have replaced Lisp with\r\nother languages in introductory programming and introductory artificial\r\nintelligence courses.  It is my hope that making the programs from PAIP\r\navailable in a commonly-taught language will provide a useful hands-on resource\r\nfor beginning AI students.\r\n\r\nThe following programs are available, each with annotated source:\r\n\r\n- [General Problem Solver][GPS], means-ends analysis problem solving\r\n- [Eliza][], a pattern-matching psychiatrist\r\n- [Search][], a collection of search algorithms\r\n- [Logic][], a library for logic programming\r\n- [Prolog][], a basic Prolog interpreter\r\n- [Emycin][], an expert system shell\r\n- [Othello][], some game-playing strategies for the Othello board game\r\n\r\nUnit tests and some example applications are provided for each of these; see the\r\n`paip/tests` and `paip/examples` directories or the links from the annotated\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n[GPS]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/gps.html\r\n[Eliza]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/eliza.html\r\n[Search]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/search.html\r\n[Logic]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/logic.html\r\n[Prolog]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/prolog.html\r\n[Emycin]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/emycin.html\r\n[Othello]: http://dhconnelly.github.com/paip-python/docs/paip/othello.html\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nGet the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python) or\r\njust [download](https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python/zipball/master) the\r\nlatest version.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure you have [Python 2.7](http://python.org/download/releases).\r\n\r\n- To run the examples: `python run_examples.py` and follow the prompts.\r\n- To run the Prolog interpreter: `./prolog.py`.  Pass the `-h` flag for more\r\n  details on its use and capabilities.\r\n- To run the unit tests: `python run_tests.py`.\r\n- To build the documentation: `python build_docs.py`.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python)\r\n- write code in `paip/`\r\n- add unit tests in `paip/tests`\r\n- make sure all tests pass: `python run_tests.py`\r\n- send me a pull request\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nThese programs were written by [Daniel Connelly](http://dhconnelly.com) at\r\nGeorgia Tech as an independent project supervised by [Professor Ashok\r\nGoel](http://home.cc.gatech.edu/dil/3).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
