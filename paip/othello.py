## The rules of the game

### Board representation

# We represent the board as a 100-element list, which includes each square on
# the board as well as the outside edge.  Each consecutive sublist of ten
# elements represents a single row, and each list element stores a piece.

#     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? . . . o @ . . . ?
#     ? . . . @ o . . . ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? . . . . . . . . ?
#     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

# The outside edge is marked ?, empty squares are ., black is @, and white is o.
# The black and white pieces represent the two players.
EMPTY, BLACK, WHITE, OUTER = '.', '@', 'o', '?'
PIECES = (EMPTY, BLACK, WHITE, OUTER)
PLAYERS = {BLACK: 'Black', WHITE: 'White'}

# To refer to neighbor squares we can add a direction to a square.
UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT = -10, 10, -1, 1
UP_RIGHT, DOWN_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT, UP_LEFT = -9, 11, 9, -11
DIRECTIONS = (UP, UP_RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN_RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN_LEFT, LEFT, UP_LEFT)

### Making moves
